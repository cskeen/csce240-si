#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	cout << "Hello World!\n";
	return 0;
}

// Thoughts about this example...
//
// How is 'int main() {' different from its java equivalent 'public static void main() {'?
//
// What is 'using namespace std;' doing in this code? Explain it in your own words, to your own satisfaction.
//
// Explain in your own words why 'cout << "Hello World!\n"' is structured like it is.
//
// Would 'std.cout << "Hello World!\n";' work just as well?
