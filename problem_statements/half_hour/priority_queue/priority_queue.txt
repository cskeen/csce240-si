Not every problem requires digging deep into the weeds and starting from first principles. Write a “real world style” 
priority queue the easy way. Use the C++ standard <list> container class (documentation is available online) to implement 
a priority queue to prioritize a list of 11 words with the smallest words having priority over the largest. The program 
should print the words to the console according to their priority. This can be used to make a priority queue as either a 
stack or a heap, your choice.

List of words: 
{“four”, “puzzling”, “a”, “apple”, “orange”, “oranges”, “to”, “longjumping”, “the”, “blackjack”, “maximizing”}
