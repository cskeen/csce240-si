Problem: Given a collection of integers, use a merge sort to find 
and remove the duplicate entries. The order of the result does not 
matter, so long as every element is unique. Wikipedia has an article 
on how merge sorts work. Your program should be able to parse a string
such as the one provided as "testing input".



Testing input: “{1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6, 7, 8}”

Expected output: “{1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8}”
