Implement the add function in template_adder.cpp, then write the resulting 
value on your CfU sheet. You'll do this by making use of templates to add 
two Number objects together and return the sum as a signed integer. You only 
need to implement the add function: everything else is already written for 
you.

Note: Make sure to check the makefile!
