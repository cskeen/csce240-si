"Trivia Master" -  trivia game intended for display on a projector.

 This is a long-term project for session "regulars" visiting the CSCE 240 
 Section 002 Sessions. We'll be using the lessons learned in CSCE 240 to 
 implement a real piece of software. "Jeopardy" is the pre-midterm project,
 and it will be used in the midterm two-hour review session.

 Question: How does the game work?

 Answer: Trivia Master combines ideas from a few other trivia games. The
 basic idea is that a question is asked to the students attending a session.
 Students can answer as either a group or as individuals, depending on how
 the SI leader has configured it. The SI leader will provide a header and 
 code to handle the networking aspects as a "black box" for students. A 
 student needs to be able to register his or herself as an individual or
 part of a group.

 Question: Any stretch goals?

 Answer: Absolutely! If progress goes faster than expected, we can implement
 a few other features, like “phone a friend”, and “ask the audience”. We’ll 
 see how it goes.

 Question: Why do this? I don't need more work!

 Answer: Nobody learns to program by listening to other people talk about
 programming. This is a simple program that will end up touching on every
 concept discussed in the first half of the course. If you understand and
 can meaningfully contribute to this game, you'll do fine on the tests and
 projects. Plus, I'm not going to give you a grade. This lets you test and
 learn programming concepts without having to risk your course grade.
 Believe it or not, it’s easier to learn to program by doing something fun 
 That you want to do, rather than doing something boring that you’re 
 forced to do.
